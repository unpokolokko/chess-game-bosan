♟️ React Chess Board — “Check Yourself”

From public holiday boredom… to a full-blown chessboard obsession.

🧩 The Story

Problem statement - my friend told me she doesn't know how to play chess and what movement each piece can/cannot do.

Opportunity -
It was Deepavali & I got bored — so instead of doing normal-people things,
with a jar full of murrukus, I ended up deep-diving into code (again).

Back in my study days, I built a simple chess game (using Java) for a school project. 
This time, I decided to rebuild it from scratch — to see how far I’ve leveled up since then (and to dust off my logic-thinking muscles 🧠).

So here we are — a fully working, turn-based chessboard built in React.
It started small, then… well, I got carried away.

🕹️ Features That Make Me Proud

🎨 Fully interactive chessboard — rendered purely with React + styled-components

⚡ Turn-based play — automatic switching between white and black

♟️ Real chess logic — each piece follows its legal moves

💅 Clean, responsive layout — looks good on any screen size

💡 Readable, modular code — every piece has its own movement brain

⚙️ Tech I Used

React — because who doesn’t love components

Styled-components — styling that stays classy and scoped

JavaScript (ES6) — because logic deserves some clarity

npm / CRA — for setup and running it all

🚀 Run It Yourself
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/react-chess-board.git
cd react-chess-board
npm install
npm start


Then open 👉 http://localhost:3000

🧠 What I Learned (or Re-learned)

Chess logic gets really tricky when you code it from scratch

React’s re-render rules can test your patience

Writing clean, modular logic saves future-you a lot of pain

Debugging + marukkus at 2 a.m. & Kuch Kuch Hota Hai OSTs on the background = BEST DEEPAVALI VIBES EVER????!!!

🧭 Next on the Board

⏱ Add check & checkmate detection

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Add multiplayer via WebSocket or Firebase

🤖 Maybe a baby AI opponent

🔊 Add move animations + sound effects

🧠 Build a small game history tracker

🧍‍♀️ About Me

Hey, I’m Nurizzati Rohim — I build things that mix logic + aesthetics.
Half designer, half bug-hunter, 100% fueled by curiosity (and matcha), undiagnosed attention deficit slay-er💅

“Still got a few more items to redo...
Guess I’ll see you guys next public holiday.
Or maybe Christmas — who knows, haha.”
